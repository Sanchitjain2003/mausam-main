These are the instruction for any person viewing our Project or IBM Mentors.

Our Project in short is based on collecting data through Arduino sensors like temperature,
rainfall, pressure, humidity etc.

1. There will be many folders like Predicting Temperature.. they contain all the code we have used to build the model. Since, our model is primarly build on prediction, we have build 4 models - Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic
Regression (only for precipitation) then we have choosen the best model out of these.

2. There are the data sets we have removed all unnecessary columns, but do have a raw dataset
uploaded as well. Do change the directory of datasets if any one wants to run our code.

3. We have trained all model and kept them in Trained Models folder excluding Random Forest as these files were too large.

4. For running our model, go to main.ipynb run it sequentially don't run the arduino control block as it would generate error rather run the input block where you have to give the temp.,humidity, precipitation. Do uncomment all the lines in input block

5. All the prediction will be given out with graphs, min max temp and properly dated predictions.

Hope you like my Project!
